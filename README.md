# kaggle_podcast_listening_time_prediction
The Kaggle **"Predict Podcast Listening Time"** dataset presents a regression problem where the goal is to predict the average listening duration of a podcast episode. This dataset, often part of Kaggle's Playground Series, is a synthetic collection of podcast metadata and user engagement data. 

The core challenge is to build a model that can accurately predict the ``Listening_Time_minutes`` based on various features of the podcast. These features include episode attributes like ``length``, ``genre``, ``title``, and ``sentiment``, as well as characteristics of the host and any guests, such as their popularity and the number of ads included in the episode. The dataset's complexity often lies in identifying and leveraging the correlations and interactions between these features to create a robust model, which is typically evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.

## 1. Loading the Dataset
This initial phase involves reading the project's data into the working environment. We'll use libraries like pandas to import the dataset, which is typically stored in a file format like CSV, and convert it into a structured format like a DataFrame. This step is crucial as it's the foundation for all subsequent data manipulation and analysis.

## 2. Data Sanity Check
Once the data is loaded, I perform a sanity check to ensure its integrity and quality. This involves a quick but thorough review to identify any immediate issues. Key tasks include:

a. Checking for missing values and deciding on a strategy to handle them (e.g., imputation or removal).

b. Verifying data types to make sure each column is in the correct format (e.g., numerical data is not stored as text).

c. Inspecting the number of rows and columns to ensure the dataset size is as expected.

d. Looking at a few sample rows to get a feel for the data's structure and content.

This phase helps us catch and fix basic data problems early on, preventing errors in later stages.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of using visualization and statistical methods to understand the dataset's main characteristics. I'll explore the data to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies. This phase includes:

a. Descriptive statistics: Calculating metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns.

b. Data visualization: Creating charts like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to visually represent the data and its distributions.

c. Correlation analysis: Examining the relationships between different variables to identify which features might be most predictive.

The insights gained from EDA are vital for guiding our feature engineering and model selection.


## 4. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models. This is often the most impactful stage of the project. During this phase, we'll transform raw data into a format that better represents the underlying problem to the model. This might involve:

a. Creating new features from existing ones (e.g., combining two columns to form a new, more informative one).

b. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction. 

c. Categorical encoding (Dummy/OneHot/etc).

d. Scaling numerical features to ensure they have a similar range, which helps some algorithms converge faster.

e. Clustering

f. Feature Selection

## 5. Running Machine Learning Models
In this final phase, we'll apply various machine learning models to the prepared data. Based on the problem (e.g., classification, regression), we'll select appropriate algorithms and train them on the dataset. The process typically involves:

a. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

b. Training different models on the training data.

c. Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models' performance.

d. Evaluating the models on the test set using relevant metrics to assess their accuracy and effectiveness.

This stage culminates in selecting the best-performing model for the task.

## 6. Evalutaion metrics
Since, this is a regression task, instead of a classification task, I will use the following to evaluate the ML models:

a. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. It is easy to interpret as it is in the same units as the output variable. MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE.

b. Mean Squared Error (MSE): MSE is the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. It penalizes large errors more heavily than MAE, making it sensitive to outliers. The output is in squared units, which can make it less intuitive to interpret.
 
c. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): RMSE is the square root of the MSE. It brings the error back to the original units of the target variable, making it more interpretable than MSE. Like MSE, it is sensitive to outliers.

d. R-squared: Also known as the coefficient of determination, R2 represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A value of 1 indicates a perfect model, while a value of 0 suggests the model explains none of the variance.
